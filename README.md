The software testing lifecycle (STLC) is a crucial aspect of the  software development process that helps ensure the delivery of high-quality, reliable, and secure software applications.


The Software Testing Lifecycle
-------------------------------

What is the Software Testing Lifecycle?
The software testing lifecycle (STLC) is a structured and systematic approach to software testing that consists of multiple phases, each with specific objectives and deliverables.


Why Does the Software Testing Life Cycle Matter?
Delivering a bug-free product enhances the user experience and ultimately leads to higher customer satisfaction.


What is SDLC?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process that covers the complete journey of a software product from its inception to its deployment.
It involves various phases, such as planning, design, development, testing, and maintenance, that ensure the successful delivery of a high-quality software product.


What is the role of the STLC in the SDLC?
STLC acts as a checkpoint in SDLC to ensure that the final product meets the desired requirements and delivers a smooth user experience.


Who performs STLC?
A team of skilled software testers or quality assurance (QA) professionals performs the STLC.


What is the outcome of STLC?
The primary outcome of STLC is a high-quality software product with fewer defects, improved functionality, and enhanced performance.


What is the entry criteria in software testing?
The entry criteria in  software testing refer to the conditions or requirements that must be met before the testing process can begin.
Some standard entry criteria include the availability of a stable build, a completed test plan, clearly defined test cases, data, and a fully configured test environment.


What is the exit criteria in software testing?
The exit criteria in software testing define the conditions that must be met before the testing process can be considered complete.
Some typical exit criteria include the successful execution of all test cases, identifying and resolving high-priority defects, full functional coverage, and meeting the project's predefined quality standards.


When does STLC end?
STLC ends when the exit criteria have been met, indicating that the software product has achieved the desired level of quality and is ready for deployment.


Phases of the Software Testing Lifecycle:

Test Planning
In this phase, the testing team defines the scope, objectives, and strategy for testing.

Test Design
During the test design phase, the testing team develops test cases, scenarios, and test data based on the requirements and specifications of the  software

Test Execution
In this phase, the testing team executes the test cases and scenarios, comparing the actual and expected results.

Test Analysis
The next step is to analyze the test results. The analysis includes identifying any defects that were found and determining the severity of the defects.

Defect Reporting
When defects are identified during test execution, they are logged and reported to the development team.

Defect Fixing
The development team fixes the defects, and the testing team retests the software to ensure the issues have been resolved.

Test Closure
In the final phase of the STLC, the testing team evaluates the test results, creates reports, and archives test artifacts.
